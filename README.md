# V-Braille
Welcome to the repository !!  This is a research project in which a prototype of a multi-line Braille e-reader was developed. The project was aimed at digitalizing the reading style of visually impaired by replacing large and hefty braille books by e-readers. Arduino along with actuators was used to enable the vertical motion to create a stimulus to the users.
